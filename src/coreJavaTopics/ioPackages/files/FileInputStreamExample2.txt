Exception Handling
The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

Note:
Custom exceptions are used to display user defined exception messages to the user.

What is Exception?
In Java, an Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.
It is an object which is thrown at runtime.

Hierarchy of Exception:
Java.lang.Throwable class is the super class of all the exceptions and errors. Throwable is inherited by two subclasses which is Exception and Error.

There are mainly 2 types of Exception:
1. Checked Exception
It is also called as Compile Time Exception.
The classes that directly inherits the Throwable class except Runtime Exception and Error are known as Checked Exceptions.
Ex: IOException, SQLException, etc

2. Unchecked Exception
Unchecked exceptions are Runtime exceptions.
The classes that inherit the Runtime Exception are known as Unchecked Exception.
Ex: ArithematicException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

3. Error
It is irrecoverable.
Some of the examples are OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowerror.
